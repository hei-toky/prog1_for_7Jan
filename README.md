# prog1_for_7Jan
A basic project for HEI to help understand the basics of unit testing

This showcases how you can test if a number is a prime number. Moreover I included some of battle devs basic testing, but you can further enhance the tests if you do so wish, you don't really have to do much outside of testing the right and wrong values, and check the boundaries of your functions.

Trust, but verify with unit testing.
